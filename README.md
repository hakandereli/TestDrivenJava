# TestDrivenJava 🧪

This repository contains practical and well-structured examples of different testing techniques in Java, including:

- ✅ **Unit Testing** with JUnit 5
- 🔁 **Mocking** with Mockito
- 🔗 **Integration Testing** with Spring Boot
- 🐳 **Container-based Testing** using Testcontainers
- 🚦 **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflows
- 📈 **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** patterns
- 🔒 **Security & edge-case testing**

## 💡 Purpose

To serve as a reference and learning base for writing clean, effective, and maintainable tests for Java applications — from simple methods to complex systems.

## 📁 Structure
- src-main/java → Application code
- src-test/java → Test code
    - /unit → Pure unit tests with JUnit
    - /integration → Spring-based integration tests
    - /mocks → Examples with Mockito & mock behavior
    - /testcontainers → Dockerized test environments
    - /tdd → TDD-style progressive examples
    - /bdd → BDD-style tests with descriptive scenarios

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Maven or Gradle (build tools)
- JUnit 5 (Jupiter)
- Mockito
- Spring Boot (for integration testing)
- Testcontainers
- AssertJ, Hamcrest (for expressive assertions)
